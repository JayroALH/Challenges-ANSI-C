# Challenges ANSI C

This repo will be a collection of challenges and mind benders. The challenge itself will either be written in the head of the file, or in a separate text file. Each challenge will be stored in a separate sub folder.

# ANSI C, K&R C, and other variations of C

There are a series of different versions of C, code written in one variant might not compile with a compiler meant for another version. This collection do not focus much on the version of C, but rather collects different coding challenges. Some of these challenges might be fun in a classroom situation, while others illustrates what the language are capable of doing.
